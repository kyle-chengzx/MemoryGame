This is my memory game for Shopify Mobile Developer Intern (Android) - Winter 2020

I have used okhttp3 and gson 3rd party library to read in the API called to grab images for the memory game

    implementation 'com.squareup.okhttp3:okhttp:3.9.1'
    implementation 'com.google.code.gson:gson:2.8.5'

All bonuses added

1. Able to configure match to 2,3 or 4 products in the start screen.
2. You are able to select the column of the grid size.
3. Added a toolbar to user points when he matches a card.
4. Added a button to shuffle the cards in the toolbar.
5. I added a one minute timer for every game so it is possible to lose.
